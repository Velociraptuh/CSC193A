                <p>I find it interesting how many people <u>actually like pickles</u>. They were just <em>simply</em> something I could never get behind but
                    a lot of people <strong>love</strong> them? They like the sweet but bitter twangy taste. <strong>I</strong><br /> personally<br /> 
                    think<br /> its weird. Whats even more weird/interesting 
                    that I hate pickles but I really like <em>relish</em>?
                </p>
                <p> I have even included some information here on <a href="https://soyummy.com/food-news/18-reasons-pickles-disgusting/"
                title="If you really wanna know">why they are inferior.</a></p>
                <p>But relish is <em>sooooooo</em> much better</p>
